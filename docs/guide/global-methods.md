# Global methods

`Anymod` is a global JavaScript object that provides access to all of the mods on a page along with several useful utility functions. You can interact with it to read and write data, hook into mod events, load and render mods, and more.

## Anymod.ready [TODO]

::: tip
You don't need to use `Anymod.ready` in a mod's own code: it will already be ready.
