# Image galleries

## How it works

Anymod lets you easily add image galleries to any page.

Images can be replaced and rearranged by anyone on your team, with no coding knowledge needed.

When you add a gallery mod to your page, it will look normal to visitors. For users on your team however, a pencil icon will appear on the right side of the page:

## From the library

<mod mod-key="kokob"/>

## Customizing a gallery

## Creating from scratch
