title: Make your page editable

In this example, we'll make an existing piece of content on a website editable through Anymod.

### 1. Find the content that you want to make editable

If you have a block of content in mind, find the file for it in your code base and also open the page with your browser.

For this example, we'll use a basic block of content on a very simple web page:

[img]

The code for this content is also simple:

```html
<h2>Example content</h2>
<p>Marketing deployment innovator incubator early adopters...</p>
<p>Alpha bandwidth infrastructure niche market partnership...</p>
```

### 2. Add a mod to your project

In the Anymod dashboard, click **New Mod** and then choose the "Content block" mod. Or you can fork the content block mod [here](https://anymod.com/mod/errba).

::: tip
We're using a simple "Content block" mod for this example, but you can use & customize any other mod to have editable content too. See the [mod library](https://anymod.com/library) for more options.

### 3. Click the *Content* button in the mod editor

This will let you edit the content in your new mod.

### 4. Copy your content and paste it into the editor

When you are finished updating the content, click the **Publish** button to publish your new content.
