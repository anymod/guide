In this example, we'll create a draft of website content.

**Drafts have 2 main use cases:**

 - Making content changes without them being "live"
 - Allowing someone to edit content without an AnyMod account

### 1. Create a draft

In the AnyMod dashboard for your project, click **Drafts** in the side menu, then click **New website draft**.

Enter the URL where your mod(s) can be found and optionally add a name for the draft, then click **Create draft**.

### 2. Visit the link for the draft

Each draft has a custom link that you can visit to access the draft.  This link will work whether you're logged in to AnyMod or not, which means you can share it with others.

### 3. Use the editor pencil to make edits

When you visit the link, a pencil will appear on the right side of the page. Click the pencil to choose a mod and edit its content.

Once you've edited a mod, click **Save Draft**. A button will now appear on the page to let you toggle between **Your draft** and the **Live site**.

### 4. Publish the draft

Changes made to a draft are not visible on the live website until the draft is published.

Back in the AnyMod dashboard, select your draft to review its changes. Click **Publish all** to make the draft live.

### 5. Set a publishing password (optional)

You can add a password to each draft to enable publishing without logging into AnyMod. 

Click **Settings** for your draft, then enter your desired password and click **Set password**:

Now when you click the editor pencil on your page, you can click the menu button and then choose **Publish with password**.  Enter the password and click **Publish draft** to publish the draft.
